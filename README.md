## Questions
- Does destroying plevel give something to the player?
  - Maybe gives him a sazenička?
- How many flowers can the player spawn?

## TODO
- Player movement
- Game progression
  - Initial, only sazeničky
  - Konev comes into action
  - First plevel spawns
  - Motyka is revealed
  - The full garden is available
  - More and more plevel spawns
  - When the plevel overwhelms the garden it transforms into a colored garden
- Zooming out camera
  - Based on progression
- Items
  - _Ownership_
   - Can the player hold only a single one?
   - Can the player pick them up as items?
   -> The player can hold only a single itme at a time
      The items are swapped
  - Flower sazeničky
    - Spawns one of _n_ plants at a time
  - Konev
    - Has to be refilled at the well
    - Has only _n_ 
  - Motyka
- Planting flowers
  - Spawn a growing plant object
- Plevel
  - Spawns ?randomly?
