## Questions
- Does destroying plevel give something to the player?
  - Maybe gives them a sazeniƒçka? -> Yes, to bed√Ωnka
  - Maybe gives them a speed boost
- How many flowers can the player spawn?

## TODO
- Game progression
  - Initial, only sazeniƒçky
  - Konev comes into action
  - First plevel spawns
  - Motyka is revealed
  - The full garden is available
  - More and more plevel spawns
  - When the plevel overwhelms the garden it transforms into a colored garden
- Zooming out camera
  - Based on progression
- Items
  - Flower sazeniƒçky bed√Ωnka
    - Holds up to 4 sazaniƒçky
    - Spawns one of _n_ plants at a time
  - Konev
    - Has to be refilled at the well
    - Has only _n_ charges
    - Enables the player to water the plants
  - Motyka
    - Removes plevel after a duration
      - Maybe a mini-game? üòÇ
    - Enables the player to remove plevel
- Flower
  - Spawn a growing plant object
  - Has to be watered
  - After watering, it grows
  - Track how many watering charges have been dispatched to the flower
- Plevel
  - Spawns ?randomly?
    - Likely nearby flowers
  - Can be removed by the player
    - After a timeout aka. _holding_ the motyka activated
- ?Meditation
  - Calls zal√©vac√≠ cloud
- Audio
  - Looping
- [x] Player movement
- [x] Item swapping


### Item
- The player can hold only a single item at a time
- The items are swapped

- Keep active item as a variable?
- How about reparenting the item?
- And maybe both
- Detect collision with the item

- We have three items, each gives the player a different ability
-
